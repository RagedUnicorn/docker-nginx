# docker-nginx

> A docker base image to build a container for Nginx based on Alpine-Linux

## Using the image

#### Start container

The container can be easily started with `docker-compose` command.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Stop container

To stop all services from the docker-compose file

```
docker-compose down
```

## Dockery

In the dockery folder are some scripts that help out avoiding retyping long docker commands but are mostly intended for playing around with the container. For production use docker-compose or docker stack should be used.

#### Build Image

The build script builds a container with a defined name

```
sh dockery/dbuild.sh
```

#### Run container

Runs the built container. If the container was already run once it will `docker start` the already present container instead of using `docker run`

```
sh dockery/drun.sh
```

#### Attach container

Attaching to the container after it is running

```
sh dockery/dattach.sh
```

#### Stop container

Stopping the running container

```
sh dockery/dstop.sh
```

## Configuration

Most of the configuration can be changed with the `nginx.conf` configuration files. Both of those files are copied into the container on buildtime. After a change to one of those files the container must be rebuilt.

## Healthcheck

The production image supports a simple healthcheck whether the container is healthy or not. This can be configured inside `docker-compose.yml`.

## Test

To do basic tests of the structure of the container use the `docker-compose.test.yml` file.

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`

For more info see [container-test](https://github.com/RagedUnicorn/docker-container-test).

Tests can also be run by category such as command, fileExistence and metadata tests by starting single services in `docker-compose.test.yml`.

```
# basic file existence tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test
# command tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test-command
# metadata tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test-metadata
```

The same tests are also available for the `dev-image`

```
# basic file existence tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test
# command tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test-command
# metadata tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test-metadata
```

## Development

To debug the container and get more insight into the container use the `docker-compose-dev.yml`
configuration. This will also allow external clients to connect to the database. By default the port `3306` will be publicly exposed.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

By default the launchscript `/docker-entrypoint.sh` will not be used to start the Nginx process. Instead the container will be setup to keep `stdin_open` open and allocating a pseudo `tty`. This allows for connecting to a shell and work on the container. A shell can be opened inside the container with `docker attach [container-id]`. Nginx itself can be started with `./docker-entrypoint.sh`.
